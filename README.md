# AmkMcAuth-v1.4.4-Bandaid
Fork of AmkMcAuth by Amk soft.
this is an attempt to fix some problems that I occurs in the master. might not be a graceful fix, but a working one (I hope).

Issue Fixed:
- changepass/changepassword not working
- Password in SQL not updated
- PLAYER_REGISTERED_OTHERCASE error when username is mixed-case or, when Loggin in with new username when the "playernames" file is exists.
