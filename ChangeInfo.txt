// What is Changed in this version (1.4.4)
//
// Code-fixup, removed old unused code.
// You can now put color in all your language file messages.
//
// Added better support for Single-MySQL database support in your Minecraft Server-Network
// But still not perfect (to prevent serverlag on MySQL queries), working on that.
//
// New-Features:
// added OnRgstr event (Join-Event when new Player has to Register his PlayerName).
// added OnGrace event (Join-Event when Player was logged in before: Grace login/No password).
//
// Every event console command excution can now be delayed by a number of game-ticks
// To delay a command start the command-line with the parameter: AmkWait(NumberOfTicks),
// Where NumberOfTicks is the number of game ticks to wait before running the command.
// The parameter has to be "AmkWait(..)" otherwise AmkMcAuth will run this command without waiting.
// If you wait to long the player might be logged off resulting in a message like: "No player was found".  
//
// added Hidden-Login, so the login command is not showing up in the Console/Logs, hiding the password.
// if player logs in with different UserId-case letters player will be kicked showing the players real/registerd Userid.
// server administrators have to update the languagefile entry "PLAYER_REGISTERED_OTHERCASE:" adding ", registered as: %1$s" at the end 
// so it something like : "PLAYER_REGISTERED_OTHERCASE: same playername is registered using different Character-Case!, registered as: %1$s"
//
// Bug-Fix: 
//
// Fix on IP-Address with a length more then 20 characters crashing the plugin (seen on Paper server).
// Fix on Updating Counter-Email and Ip-Adress, Random-File-pointer was located wrongly. 
//
// ToDo:
// adding bStats Server build (Spigot Paper eg.)
// adding clear player inventory on Join when not logged in and restore on Login and/or leave
// adding option to prevent player "pushing" when "teleport_to_spawn: true: is used. But Hiding not logged-in Players works! 
//        hint to use: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/entity/LivingEntity.html#setCollidable-boolean-
